# ff2-config-only-bosses
A collection of my config only bosses for the Freak Fortress 2 gamemode in Team Fortress 2

This small project is an attempt at creating bosses that only use in-game assets, rather than custom models. The idea is to create an experience that requires less custom content to be downloaded to the end user. While custom plugins may be used, the assets of the bosses are all made with base game content only.
  
  
## **Robot Sniper**  
A sniper boss that uses the Mann vs Machine Sniper bot model and voice. It gets a one hit kill sniper rifle as its rage. *Fun Fact*: This boss was obscenely overpowered on release because I gave him too many bullets. I also forgot some people are really **really** **REALLY** good at sniper. He got nerfed a bit and is now the most used of all my bosses.
  
## **Master of the Market Garden**  
This is just trolldier: the FF2 boss. He has no rage abilities except for weighdown. He does get a Battalion's Backup. I also gave him rage build on hit, so his BB can be deployed rapidly. He is more of an experiment to see how things can work if I have a boss with no rage and relied on trolldier skills alone.

## **Scout With Phlog**  
This was something I had sitting on my pc, and never uploaded. It's a very simple boss in design, but I wonder how it will be utilized.
