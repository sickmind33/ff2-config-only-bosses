# ff2-config-only-bosses
A collection of my config only bosses for the Freak Fortress 2 gamemdoe in Team Fortress 2

This small project is an attempt at creating bosses that only use in-game assets, rather than custom models. The idea is to create an experience that requires less custom content to be downloaded to the end user. While custom plugins may be used, the assets of the bosses are all made with base game content only.
